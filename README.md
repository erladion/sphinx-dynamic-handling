Testing out sphinx generation from dynamically available content.

The base of the project is the generator.py which builds up the necessary index.rst files expected by sphinx.
It does this based on metadata found in folders, subfolders and files in the chapters folder (which is assumed to exist).

The chapters folder can contain any number of folders and with any name.
What sets the ordering and naming of each chapter is the content of the .chapterconf file that exists in each subfolder.
If it exists the folder is treated as a chapter.
It should look like the following
```
[Chapter]
title = <Name of the chapter>
order = <Order, lower number places the chapter higher up>
```

Every .rst or .md file in each folder will be used as content.
Each file should contain a content_order and a content_title

For a .rst file it should look like the following 
```
.. metadata::
   :content_order: <Order of the content file in the chapter>
   :content_title: <Title of the content>
   :content_destination: <path to result file>
```
and for a .md file:
```
---
content_order: <Order of the content file in the chapter>
content_title: <Title of the content>
---
```

Specifying the :content_destination: allows for the dynamic creation of content to be used with a .. include:: directive

Example:
```
chapters/
├── chapter3/
│   ├── include-example.rst // contains the .. include:: directive
|   ├── fileA-to-be-included.rst // contains the :content_destination: property
│   └── sub-dir/
│       └── fileB-to-be-included.rst // contains the :content_destination: property

In this example the file include-example.rst contains the directive
.. include:: testing-include.rst

And both fileA-to-be-included.rst and fileB-to-be-included.rst
have the :content_destination: chapters/chapter3/testing-include

This will make it so that the generator.py script will exclude both 
fileA-to-be-included.rst and fileB-to-be-included.rst from the 
toc tree creation and use them for creation of a new file called 
testing-include.rst
containing two include directives like this:

.. include:: fileA-to-be-included.rst

.. include:: sub-dir/fileB-to-be-included.rst
```
